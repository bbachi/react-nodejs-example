Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on Docker
defined using the [Compose file format](https://compose-spec.io).
A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up
your application are configured.
Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your application with a
single command: `docker compose up`.


# Where to get Docker Compose

### Windows and macOS

Docker Compose is included in
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
for Windows and macOS.

### Linux

You can download Docker Compose binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) on this repository.

Rename the relevant binary for your OS to `docker-compose` and copy it to `$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins`

Or copy it into one of these folders to install it system-wide:

* `/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`
* `/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins` OR `/usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins`

(might require making the downloaded file executable with `chmod +x`)


Quick Start
-----------

Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:
1. Define your app's environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be
   reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so
   they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Lastly, run `docker compose up` and Compose will start and run your entire
   app.

A Compose file looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
```
